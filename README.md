This is an attempt to reverse engineer the physics of Micro Machines, with focus on the NES version first. This is very WIP and many things may not look right yet. For now, all it can do is turn the vehicle, with special properties for tanks and choppers.

Xbox controls based on NES controller, keyboard controls based on Amiga/DOS. This will be customizable in the future.
Controls:
Accelerate: A (Xbox), F (Keyboard)
Brake: X (Xbox), C (Keyboard)
Left: D-Pad Left (Xbox), Z (Keyboard)
